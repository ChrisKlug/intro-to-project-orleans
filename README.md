# Project Orleans Intro

This repo contains the source code for the demos used in my __Introduction to Actor-based Development with Project Orleans__.

## Pre-requisites

The code requires 1 or 2 environment variables to be set up. 

To run the Dashboard WPF application, you need an environment variable called `POIMap`, that contains an API key for Bing Maps. 

__Note:__ If you do not have a Bing Maps API key, which is likely, you can create one at https://www.bingmapsportal.com/.

If you want to try the Azure Storage clustering, you will need an environment variable called `POIAzure` that contains a connectionstring to a storage account where it can use the Table Storage to store the clustering information.
